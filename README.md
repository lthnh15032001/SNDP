## ðŸš€ Quick start
Build from source or use our latest release [release](https://github.com/lthnh15032001/SNDP/releases/tag/)

#### Build from source
```
make  build
```

**1.  Server**
   ```
    ./SNDP server --port [PORT] --reverse [--authfile ./users.json]
   ```
  ex: `./SNDP server --port 8081 --reverse`
The command runs a server on port 8081, which is responsible for hosting a server and accepting connections. For additional command customization, check out [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)

**2. Client**
   ```
    ./SNDP client [serverIP] R:[SERVER_PORT]:[HOST]:[HOST_PORT]
   ```
  ex: `./SNDP client localhost:8081 R:55555:localhost:5555`
The command runs a client that connects to the above server and streams TCP data from localhost on port 5555 to port 55555 on the server.  For additional command customization, check out [chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)
**3. API**
   Make sure you have a database and keycloak by running `docker-compose up --d` (currently support `mysql` and `sqlite`), change connection information for adapting your requirement, we assume that keycloak running local at port `8080` and database mysql's port `3306`
